## Note
This repository is the quickstart repository. See http://zeroth.io/guide/quick-start for documentation on how to get started using the Zeroth CLI.

Zeroth is currently in developer preview (alpha) phase. Follow https://twitter.com/zeroth for updates

## Overview
Zeroth is a typescript full stack framework, with primary goals being cross-environment reusability and api rigidity achieved through strong typing with isomorphic components and documentation/test automation.

## Goals
1. Angular(2) at it's core. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, and where possible Zeroth will use Angular components
2. API first (or only). A Zeroth application can be just a REST api with no frontend
3. Strict, standards compliant API - strict interfaces for API design conforms to REST standards and best practices, allowing for easy interoperability of components (first or third party)
4. Common components between front & back end. Models, mocks, utilities etc are all platform independent
5. Easy integration. A developer should be able to integrate a full stack component with only an npm install
6. Seamless (and continuous) deployment. Deploys should be completely hassle free, including database migrations
